# My Library App

My Library App is a simple web application that allows users to manage a virtual library. Users can add, view, update, and remove books, as well as mark them as read or unread.

---

## Features

1. **Add New Books**: Users can add books to their library by filling out the form with the book's title, author, number of pages, and whether they have read the book.
2. **View Books**: Displays all books in the library dynamically in the browser.
3. **Mark as Read/Unread**: Users can toggle the "read" status of any book in their library.
4. **Remove Books**: Books can be removed from the library with a single click.
5. **Responsive Design**: The app adapts to various screen sizes for a better user experience.

---

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5**: For structuring the layout of the application.
- **CSS3**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For functionality, including adding, removing, and toggling books.

---

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Use the "Add Book" button to open the book form.
4. Fill in the form with the book details and click "Add New Book" to add it to the library.
5. Manage the books using the "Remove" or "Read" buttons displayed under each book.

---

## File Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html      // Main HTML file for the app layout
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css      // Contains the CSS for the app's styling
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js       // JavaScript file handling the app's logic
```

## How It Works

### Book Object
The `Book` constructor is used to create book objects. Each book has:
- `title` (String): The book's title.
- `author` (String): The author's name.
- `pages` (String or Number): Number of pages in the book.
- `read` (Boolean): Whether the book has been read.

### Library Array
Books are stored in the `myLibrary` array. Each book is dynamically rendered in the `.library` container.

### Dynamic Book Management
- **Add Book**: Captures input from the form, creates a new `Book` object, and pushes it to `myLibrary`.
- **Remove Book**: Removes a book from `myLibrary` by its index.
- **Toggle Read**: Changes the `read` status of a book and updates the display.

---

## Example Library Data
The app is preloaded with sample books for testing:
- *The Hobbit* by J.R.R. Tolkien (295 pages, not read)
- *Lost Gods* by Brom (300 pages, read)
- *The Child Thief* by Brom (600 pages, read)
- *Slewfoot* by Brom (545 pages, read)

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent Storage**: Use `localStorage` or a database to save the library between sessions.
2. **Advanced UI**: Add animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.
3. **Sorting and Filtering**: Allow users to sort books by title, author, pages, or read status.
4. **Edit Book Details**: Provide an option to edit existing book details.

---

## Known Issues

- The form does not validate non-numeric input for the `pages` field.
- The UI does not indicate if the form is incomplete.
